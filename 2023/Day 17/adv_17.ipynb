    "To get Desert Island the machine parts it needs as soon as possible, you'll need to find the best way to get the crucible from the lava pool to the machine parts factory. To do this, you need to minimize heat loss while choosing a route that doesn't require the crucible to go in a straight line for too long. Fortunately, the Elves here have a map (your puzzle input) that uses traffic patterns, ambient temperature, and hundreds of other parameters to calculate exactly how much heat loss can be expected for a crucible entering any particular city block. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Each city block is marked by a single digit that represents the amount of heat loss if the crucible enters that block. \n",
    "    The starting point, the lava pool, is the top-left city block; the destination, the machine parts factory, is the bottom-right city block. (Because you already start in the top-left block,on't incur that block's heat loss unless you leave that block and then return to it.)Because it is difficult to keep the top-heavy crucible going in a straight line for very long, it can move at most three blocks in a single direction before it must turn 90 degrees left or right. \n",
    "    The crucible also can't reverse direction; after entering each city block, it may only turn left, continue straight, or turn right,"
