    "The Elves responsible for water filtering operations took a snapshot of the bricks while they were still falling (your puzzle input) which should let you work out which bricks are safe to disintegrate. Each line of text in the snapshot represents the position of a single brick at the time the snapshot was taken. The position is given as two x,y,z coordinates - one for each end of the brick - separated by a tilde (~). Each brick is made up of a single straight line of cubes, and the Elves were even careful to choose a time for the snapshot that had all of the free-falling bricks at integer positions above the ground, so the whole snapshot is aligned to a three-dimensional cube grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ground is at z=0 and is perfectly flat; the lowest z value a brick can have is therefore 1. So, 5,5,1~5,6,1 and 0,2,1~0,2,5 are both resting on the ground, but 3,3,2~3,3,3 was above the ground at the time of the snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the snapshot was taken while the bricks were still falling, some bricks will still be in the air; you'll need to start by figuring out where they will end up. Bricks are magically stabilized, so they never rotate, even in weird situations like where a long horizontal brick is only supported on one end. Two bricks cannot occupy the same position, so a falling brick will come to rest upon the first other brick it encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to figure out which bricks are safe to disintegrate. A brick can be safely disintegrated if, after removing it, no other bricks would fall further directly downward. Don't actually disintegrate any bricks - just determine what would happen if, for each brick, only that brick were disintegrated. Bricks can be disintegrated even if they're completely surrounded by other bricks; you can squeeze between bricks if you need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure how the blocks will settle based on the snapshot. Once they've settled, consider disintegrating a single brick; how many bricks could be safely chosen as the one to get disintegrated?"
