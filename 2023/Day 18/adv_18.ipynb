    "The digger starts in a 1 meter cube hole in the ground. They then dig the specified number of meters up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), clearing full 1 meter cubes as they go. The directions are given as seen from above, so if \"up\" were north, then \"right\" would be east, and so on. Each trench is also listed with the color that the edge of the trench should be painted as an RGB hexadecimal color code. The next step is to dig out the interior so that it is one meter deep as well. While the interior is dug out, the edges are also painted according to the color codes in the dig plan.\n",
